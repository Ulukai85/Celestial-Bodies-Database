# Celestial Bodies Database
## Course: Relational Database

This project is part of the freeCodeCamp course "Relational Database", outlined [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/build-a-celestial-bodies-database-project/build-a-celestial-bodies-database).

To successfully pass this project I had to build a SQL database (per PostgreSQL) with five tables (moons, planets, stars, galaxies + one more), which had to fulfill multiple restrictions and conditions.

I searched for applicable online ressources and used Jupyter Notebook with pandas to scrape the html tables and integrated the data into pandas.DataFrames.
More one this here: <https://github.com/Ulukai85/celestial-bodies-database/blob/main/galaxies.ipynb>

The resulting CSV-files were copied into the file <https://github.com/Ulukai85/celestial-bodies-database/blob/main/universe.sql>
